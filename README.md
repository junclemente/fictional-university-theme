# Developing A Custom WordPress Theme

This repository contains the course files I am editing to learn how to create a custom WordPress theme.

This course is [Become a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code](https://www.udemy.com/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/) and can be found at [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com). 

I am developing locally using [Local by Flywheel](https://local.getflywheel.com/).

I have also [Vagrant](http://vagrant/.up) and [VCCW.cc](http://vccw.cc) to create a Vagrant box development environment.
